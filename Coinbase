There is a space to add a special transaction, called "coinbase", in the blocks. For every mined block, the reward coins are sent to the public key written in the coinbase.

A miner adds their own public key and as a result receives the reward coins.

Back in 2009, you’d get paid 50 bitcoins to add a new block! Nowadays, it’s down to 6.25 bitcoins. So, if you solve the puzzle first and validate the block, that transaction is also validated and you earn those bitcoins!

Context: 1 bitcoin is worth ~$16,000 dollars as of December 29, 2022.

how can a miner create new coins?

A miner creates new coins by solving complex mathematical problems and adding valid transactions to the blockchain,
the public ledger of all transactions on the network. The process of adding new transactions to 
the blockchain is called "mining" because it involves a certain degree of computational work and expense, 
and the miner who successfully completes this work is rewarded with newly created coins.

The specific process of mining a new coin block is based on the consensus algorithm
that is used by the cryptocurrency's blockchain network. For Bitcoin, this process is called Proof-of-Work (PoW). 
To add a new block of transactions to the blockchain, a miner must find a solution to a complex 
mathematical problem that is based on the current state of the blockchain. This solution, called a "hash," must meet certain criteria, 
such as having a certain number of leading zeroes. Miners compete to find the solution by running powerful computer systems that perform 
millions of calculations per second. Once a miner finds a valid solution, it gets added to the blockchain and broadcasted to the network. 
The miner who found the solution is then rewarded with newly created coins and transaction fees paid by users for confirming their transactions.

It is important to note that the process of mining is becoming increasingly competitive and requires specialized hardware, 

software, and significant amounts of electricity to be profitable.
