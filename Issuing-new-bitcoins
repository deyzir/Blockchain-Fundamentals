The money can be injected (i.e. new coins can be created) in many different ways.
This can be done by giving the initial node lots of money. Or, by giving every new node some money... Or, 
maybe by regularly adding some money to random nodes. Each method creates different incentives.

The Bitcoin system creates new coins in a way to incentivize integrity of the whole system.
New coins are created with a piece of code every time a new block is mined by nodes. 

As a result, the system incentivizes more people to become nodes and more of them to become miners.
The more miners there are, the more computation power will be needed to change the records of transactions and hack the system. 

As it gets harder and harder to hack the system, the blockchain and the economy it creates becomes more secure and, 

as a result, the coins become a more preferred currency.

New bitcoins are created through a process called mining.
Miners use powerful computer systems to validate and record transactions on the Bitcoin network.
As a reward for their work, they receive newly created bitcoins, as well as transaction fees paid by users. 
The process of mining also serves the purpose of adding new transactions to the blockchain, the public ledger of all bitcoin transactions.

The number of new bitcoins created through mining is set to decrease over time.
This decrease is built into the Bitcoin protocol through a process called halving, 
which occurs approximately every four years. The protocol is designed such that the total number of bitcoins will never exceed 21 million. 
When all bitcoins have been mined, there will be no more new bitcoins created, 
and the only way to acquire them will be through buying them from existing holders or from transaction fees.
